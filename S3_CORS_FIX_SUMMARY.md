# S3 CORS Fix Summary

## üêõ **Problem Identified**
You were getting a CORS error when uploading video files to S3:
```
Access to fetch at 'https://quick-stock-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/...' 
from origin 'https://www.stockmind.in' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## ‚úÖ **Solution Applied**

### 1. **CORS Configuration Applied**
I've successfully configured your S3 bucket (`quick-stock-media`) with the proper CORS settings:

```json
{
  "CORSRules": [
    {
      "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
      "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE", "HEAD"],
      "AllowedOrigins": [
        "http://localhost:3000",
        "https://localhost:3000", 
        "https://www.stockmind.in",
        "https://stockmind.in",
        "https://*.vercel.app",
        "https://*.netlify.app"
      ],
      "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag", "x-amz-request-id", "x-amz-id-2"],
      "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. **Files Created**
- `fix-s3-cors.js` - Script to apply CORS configuration
- `s3-cors-config.json` - Manual CORS configuration for AWS Console

## üîß **What This Fixes**

### **CORS Preflight Requests**
- Browser sends OPTIONS request before PUT request
- S3 now responds with proper CORS headers
- Allows uploads from your domain (`https://www.stockmind.in`)

### **Direct S3 Uploads**
- Your app uses pre-signed URLs for direct browser-to-S3 uploads
- This is more efficient than server-side uploads
- CORS is required for this to work

## üß™ **Testing the Fix**

### **1. Try Uploading Again**
- Go to your product upload page
- Try uploading the same video file
- Check browser developer tools for errors

### **2. Check Network Tab**
- Look for the OPTIONS request (preflight)
- Should return 200 status with CORS headers
- PUT request should succeed after preflight

### **3. Verify CORS Headers**
The response should include:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://www.stockmind.in
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
```

## üö® **If Still Having Issues**

### **1. Check S3 Bucket Permissions**
Ensure your AWS credentials have:
- `s3:PutObject` - for uploading files
- `s3:PutBucketCors` - for CORS configuration
- `s3:GetBucketCors` - for reading CORS settings

### **2. Verify Domain Match**
Make sure your domain exactly matches one in the CORS configuration:
- `https://www.stockmind.in` ‚úÖ
- `https://stockmind.in` ‚úÖ
- `http://localhost:3000` ‚úÖ (for development)

### **3. Check Browser Cache**
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try in incognito/private mode
- Try different browser

### **4. Manual CORS Configuration**
If the script didn't work, apply CORS manually:
1. Go to AWS S3 Console
2. Select your bucket (`quick-stock-media`)
3. Go to Permissions tab
4. Scroll to Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
5. Paste the configuration from `s3-cors-config.json`

## üìã **Additional Troubleshooting**

### **Check CORS Configuration**
```bash
# Verify CORS is applied
aws s3api get-bucket-cors --bucket quick-stock-media
```

### **Test with curl**
```bash
# Test preflight request
curl -X OPTIONS \
  -H "Origin: https://www.stockmind.in" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type" \
  https://quick-stock-media.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/
```

## ‚úÖ **Expected Result**

After applying this fix:
- Video uploads should work without CORS errors
- Browser will successfully upload directly to S3
- No more "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" errors
- Upload progress should work normally

## üîÑ **Next Steps**

1. **Test the upload** - Try uploading your video again
2. **Monitor logs** - Check browser console for any remaining errors
3. **Verify functionality** - Ensure the uploaded file appears in your product
4. **Report results** - Let me know if the issue is resolved or if you need further assistance

The CORS configuration has been successfully applied to your S3 bucket, so the upload should now work! üéâ
